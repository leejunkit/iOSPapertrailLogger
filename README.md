iOSPapertrailLogger
===================

Redirects NSLog (and stderr) messages to [Papertrail](http://papertrailapp.com/ "Papertrail") on iOS, useful in cases where you don't have access to the console for debugging purposes, like when you have an external accessory connected to the device's dock connector.
